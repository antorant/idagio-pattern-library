# Work Authors Label
## Purpose *
See the secondary authors for a particular work – typically alongside the composer(s) and title of a work.

Authors differ from composers, and they are represented on a subsidiary level. An analogy can be drawn with architecture: a building is attributed to an architect but many other people — such as engineers and designers — make important contributions.
